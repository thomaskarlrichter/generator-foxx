## Foxx

Foxx is a lightweight Javascript “micro framework” which
allows you to build applications directly on top of [ArangoDB]
(http://www.arangodb.org) and
therefore skip the middleman (Rails, Django, Symfony or whatever your
favorite web framework is). Inspired by frameworks like Sinatra Foxx is
designed with simplicity and the specific use case of modern client-side
MVC frameworks in mind.
